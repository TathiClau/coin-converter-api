## ðŸ›  Technologies

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

- [SpringBoot](https://expo.io/)
- [Kotlin](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreeSQL](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

## Key Concepts

- What is a transaction?
  Every time a client use de API for convert a coin, this action is saved in the database and we call it transaction.

- Access Key: To create a transaction you will need an access key generated through your free plan at http://api.exchangeratesapi.io. You also need to generate a random UUID to be your UserId. So, your body will look like this:

```
{
"accessKey": "<YOUR ACCESS>",
"userId": "c250010f-ddc5-4cec-abdd-f69d932b8b75",
"initialCoin": "EUR",
"initialValue": "10",
"finalCoin": "BRL"
}
```
